# STEREOPOLIS : 

For mass deployment of safe Level 2+ automated driving, carmakers need perception systems with a full suite of high performance lidar sensors.
We can use OS1-128 to bring safe ADAS/ADS vehicles to everyday roads across the globe.
OS1-128 which use laser pulses to reconstruct the environment surrounding a vehicle,allow automated and safe driving for cars, trucks...


## Acquisition STEREOPOLIS : 
The first step is to collect data from your environment. Before running everything on the integrated RC car, we will collect data in a simpler 
and more controlled environment with ROS and we will get a ROSBAG for imu and lidar packets. 
In the first example, an OS-1-128 is mounted to the car of acquisition with a laptop as shown in the image below.

## SLAM STEREOPOLIS : 

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a method that gives machines the ability to understand their position and orientation 
within an environment. SLAM gives machines spatial awareness by sensing, creating, and constantly updating a representation 
of the world around them.

The second step, we run FAST_LIO_SLAM :
- ROSBAG = 24.6 Go
- Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) 
- ROS Noetic
